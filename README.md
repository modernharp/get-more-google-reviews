## Company Overview
[RatingFlow is a leading **online reputation management platform** designed to help local businesses, agencies, and service providers automate the collection of positive feedback while protecting their brand from public negativity.](https://ratingflow.co/)

As a powerful **Google review management software**, RatingFlow solves the critical issue of low review volume and the disproportionate impact of negative ratings. By creating a seamless digital funnel, the platform acts as a shield for your business, ensuring that satisfied customers publicly advocate for your brand while unsatisfied customers are routed to a private resolution channel.

## How Our Google Review Management Software Works
RatingFlow operates on a smart-routing system that segments customer sentiment before it goes public.

1.  **The 5 Star Reviews Generator:** Customers who rate their experience highly (4-5 stars) are instantly redirected to public platforms like Google Maps, Facebook, or Trustpilot. This automates the growth of your social proof and improves local SEO rankings.
2.  **Negative Feedback Shield:** Customers who report a negative experience (1-3 stars) are diverted to a private internal form. This allows business owners to address complaints directly and "save" the customer relationship without suffering permanent damage to their public star rating.
